## ü™ú Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset using **Pandas**
- Checked for **missing values** and **duplicates**
- Converted **date** column to proper `datetime` format
- Filled missing values appropriately
- Removed outliers and handled inconsistent categorical entries

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined **total layoffs by year and month**
- Compared layoffs across **industries and countries**
- Identified **top 10 companies** with the highest layoffs
- Explored relationship between **percentage_laid_off** and **funds_raised_millions**
- Visualized data using **bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps**

### 3. Visualization & Insights
- **Layoffs over time:** Detected spikes and recession periods in layoffs  
- **Industry-wise trends:** Highlighted sectors most affected by job cuts  
- **Geographical analysis:** Mapped countries/regions with highest layoffs  
- **Funding correlation:** Explored how financial backing impacts layoffs

## üìà Key Insights

- Layoffs increased during periods of **economic slowdown** or **funding scarcity**  
- **Startups and early-stage companies** faced higher layoff rates due to funding constraints  
- **North America and Asia** experienced the most significant layoff waves  
- Industries like **Fintech, Cloud, and E-commerce** showed the largest fluctuations

## üß† Conclusion

This project provides data-driven insights into the dynamics of tech-sector layoffs worldwide.  
Findings indicate that global financial conditions, funding rounds, and industry cycles significantly influence workforce reductions. Companies at earlier funding stages tend to be more vulnerable, highlighting the importance of sustainable growth strategies in volatile markets.
